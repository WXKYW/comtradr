R package for interacting with the [UN Comtrade
Database](https://comtradeplus.un.org/) public API. UN Comtrade provides
historical data on the weights and value of specific goods shipped
between countries, more info can be found
[here](https://unstats.un.org/wiki/display/comtrade). Full API
documentation can be found [here](https://comtradedeveloper.un.org/).

## Currently re-launching Comtradr üöß

The Comtrade API has been undergoing extensive updates. At this point
the legacy API has been taken offline (see
[here](https://unstats.un.org/wiki/display/comtrade/New+Comtrade+FAQ+for+Advanced+Users#NewComtradeFAQforAdvancedUsers-WhatisthelegacyoftheUNComtrade?UntilwhencanIuseit?)).

In order to accomodate the new syntax, as well as adding the new
functionality, the `comtradr` package has been undergoing an extensive
re-write. Additionally, it is not possible anymore to query the API
without an API token. There still is a free version, but unlike before
you need to be a registered user to obtain the token. See the
[FAQ](https://unstats.un.org/wiki/display/comtrade/New+Comtrade+User+Guide#NewComtradeUserGuide-UNComtradeAPIManagement)
for details on how to obtain the new access tokens.

Please [report](https://github.com/ropensci/comtradr/issues) issues,
comments, or feature requests. We are very much looking for feedback on
the useability of the new functions.

The package in its old version is still available from the
`legacy-0-3-0` branch.

Please note that this package is released with a [Contributor Code of
Conduct](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/). By contributing to this

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

Currently, the package is not on CRAN, but we plan on publishing to CRAN
in the near future. Install the current development version from this
repo:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/comtradr@main")
```

Once it is on CRAN, you can install with:

``` r
install.packages("comtradr")
```

## Usage

### Authentication üîê

As stated above, you need an API token, see the
[FAQ](https://unstats.un.org/wiki/display/comtrade/New+Comtrade+User+Guide#NewComtradeUserGuide-UNComtradeAPIManagement)
for details on how to obtain the access tokens.

If you are in an interactive session, you can call the following
function to save your API token to the environment file for the current
session.

``` r
library(comtradr)

set_primary_comtrade_key()
```

If you are not in an interactive session, you can register the token
once in your session using the following base-r function.

``` r
Sys.setenv('COMTRADE_PRIMARY' = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx')
```

If you would like to set the comtrade key permanently, we recommend
editing the project `.Renviron` file, where you need to add a line with
`COMTRADE_PRIMARY = xxxx-your-key-xxxx`.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Do not forget the line break after the last entry. This is the
easiest by taking advantage of the great `usethis` package.

``` r
usethis::edit_r_environ(scope = 'project')
```

### Example 1 ‚õ¥Ô∏è

Now we can get to actually request some data. Let us query the total
trade between China and Germany and Argentina, as reported by China.

``` r

# Country names passed to the API query function must be spelled in ISO3 format. 
# For details see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3 

# You can request a maximum interval of twelve years from the API
example1 <- comtradr::ct_get_data(
  reporter = 'CHN',
  partner = c('ARG', 'DEU'),
  start_date = 2010,
  end_date = 2012
)

# Inspect the return data
str(example1)
```

### Example 2 ‚õ¥Ô∏è

Return all exports related to Wine from Argentina to all other
countries, for years 2007 through 2011.

``` r
library(comtradr)

# Fetch all shrimp related commodity codes from the Comtrade commodities DB.
# This vector of codes will get passed to the API query.
wine_codes <- ct_commodity_lookup("wine", return_code = TRUE, return_char = TRUE)

# API query.
example2 <- ct_get_data(
  reporter =  "ARG",
  flow_direction = "Export",
  partner = "all",
  start_date = 2007,
  end_date = 2011,
  commodity_code = wine_codes
)

# Inspect the output
str(example2)
```
